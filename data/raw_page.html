<br><b>Adjusted for inflation:</b>  Corrected for price changes to yield an equivalent in terms of goods and services. The adjustment divides nominal amounts for different years by price indices for those years -- e.g. the CPI (Consumer price index) or the implicit price deflator -- and multiplies by 100. This converts to real values, i.e. valued at the prices of the base year for the price index.  	
<br><b>Adjusted present value (APV):</b>   The sum of the discounted value of a project's operating cash flows (assuming equity financing) plus the value of any tax-shield benefits of interest associated with the project's financing minus any flotation costs.

Thus, in general equilibrium, an assignment of factors to industries producing goods and services, together with the assignment of resulting final goods and services to consumers, within a country or throughout the world economy.  The question is to whether or not an allocation is efficient. A change from an allocation that is not efficient to one that is may be termed an increase in efficiency.
<br><b>Allocational efficiency:</b>   The efficiency with which a market channels capital toward its most productive uses.

<br><b>Annuity factor:</b>   The term used to calculate the present value of the stream of level payments for a fixed period.	
<br><b>Annuity:</b>   A level stream of equal dollar payments that lasts for a fixed time. An example of an annuity is the coupon part of a bond with level annual payments.	
It is a series of equal payments or receipts occurring over a specified number of periods. In an ordinary annuity, payments or receipts occur at the end of each period; in an annuity due, payments or receipts occur at the beginning of each period.	
<br><b>Anti-dumping duty:</b>   Tariff levied on dumped imports. The threat of an anti-dumping duty can deter imports, even when it has not been used, and anti-dumping is therefore a form of non-tariff barrier.  Anti-dumping suit is a  complaint by a domestic producer that imports are being dumped, and the resulting investigation and, if dumping and injury are found, anti-dumping duty.  	
<br><b>Anti-dumping laws:</b>   Laws that are enacted to prevent dumping-offering prices in the overseas market that is lower than that at which a product is sold in its home domestic market.

It is finding two assets that are essentially the same, buying the cheaper, and selling the more expensive.  The process of purchasing and selling foreign exchange, stocks, bonds and other commodities in several markets intending to make profit from the difference in price.

<br><b>Ask:</b>  The price at which one can sell a currency. It is also known as the offer price.	
<br><b>Asset allocation policy:</b>   The target weights given to various asset classes in an investment portfolio.	
<br><b>Asset approach:</b>  It is for determination of the exchange rate that focuses on its role as the price of an asset. With high capital mobility, equilibrium requires that expected returns on comparable domestic and foreign assets be the same.	
<br><b>Asset securitization:</b>   The process of packaging a pool of assets and then selling interests in the pool in the form of asset-backed securities (ABS).	
<br><b>Asset:</b>   An item of property, such as land, capital, money, a share in ownership, or a claim on others for future payment, such as a bond or a bank deposit.   	
<br><b>Asset-backed securities (ABS):</b>   Debt securities whose interest and principal payments are provided by the cash flows coming from a discrete pool of assets.	
<br><b>Assets-in-place:</b>   Those assets in which the firm has already invested. Compare to growth options.

<br><b>Assignment problem:</b>	How to use macroeconomic policies to achieve both internal balance and external balance; specifically, with only monetary and fiscal policies available under fixed exchange rates, which instrument should be assigned to which goal? It is often the case that monetary policy should be assigned to external balance.  
<br><b>Asymmetric information:</b>   The failure of two parties to a transaction to have the same relevant information. Examples are buyers who know less about product quality than sellers, and lenders who know less about likely default than borrowers. Both are common in international markets.  	
<br><b>Asymmetric shock:</b>   An exogenous change in macroeconomic conditions affecting differently the different parts of a country, or different countries of a region. Often it is mentioned as a source of difficulty for countries sharing a common currency, such as the Euro Zone.   	
<br><b>At par:</b>   At equality. Two currencies are said to be at par if they are trading one-for-one. The significance is more psychological then economic, but the long decline of the Canadian dollar below par with the U.S. dollar, and the more recent decline of the euro from above to below par, also with the U.S. dollar, has been cause for concern.	
<br><b>Atlantic Development Group for Latin America (ADELA):</b>  An international private investment company dedicated to the socioeconomic development of Latin America. Its objective is to strengthen private enterprise by providing capital and entrepreneurial and technical services.	
<br><b>At-the-money option:</b>   An option with an exercise price that is equal to the current value of the underlying asset.  An option whose exercise price is the same as the spot exchange rate.	
<br><b>Autarky price:</b>   Price in autarky; that is, the price of something within a country when it is not traded by that country. Relative autarky prices turn out to be the most theoretically robust (but empirically elusive) measures of comparative advantage.   	
<br><b>Autarky:</b>    In models of international trade, a situation in which there is no cross-border trade.  It is the situation of not engaging in international trade; self-sufficiency. Not to be confused with autarchy which in at least some dictionaries is a political term rather than an economic one, and means absolute rule or power?  	
<br><b>Automated clearinghouse (ACH) electronic transfer:</b>   This is essentially an electronic version of the depository transfer check.	
<br><b>Automatic stabilizer:</b>   It is an institutional feature of an economy that dampens its macroeconomic fluctuations, e.g., an income tax, which acts like a tax increase in a boom and a tax cut in a recession.  	
<br><b>Autonomous transaction:</b> In the balance of payments, a transaction that is not itself a result of actions taken officially to manage international payments; in contrast with accommodating transaction.   	
<br><b>Autonomous:</b>	Refers to an economic variable, magnitude, or entity that is caused independently of other variables that it may in turn influence; exogenous.   
<br><b>Aval:</b>    A guarantee of the buyer's credit provided by the guarantor, unless the buyer is of unquestioned financial standing. The aval is an endorsement note as opposed to a guarantee agreement.	
<br><b>Avalisation:</b>    Payment undertaking given by a bank in respect of a bill of exchange drawn.	
<br><b>Average accounting return (AAR):</b>    The average project earnings after taxes and depreciation divided by the average book value of the investment during its life.	
<br><b>Average cost:</b>   Total cost divided by output.  	
<br><b>Average product:</b>   The average product of a factor in a firm or industry is its output divided by the amount of the factor employed.  	
<br><b>Average tariff:</b>   An average of a country's tariff rates. This can be calculated in several ways, none of which are ideal for representing how protective the country's tariffs are.  Most common is the trade-weighted average tariff, which under-represents prohibitive tariffs, since they get zero weight.  	
<a name="rb"> </a> </p><p> 
<br><b>B2B exchange:</b>   Business-to-business Internet marketplace that matches supply and demand by real-time auction bidding.
<br><b>Back-to-Back Loan:</b>  An intercompany loan, also known as a fronting loan or link financing that is channeled through a bank.
<br><b>Backward bending:</b>   Refers to a curve that reverses direction, usually if, after moving out away from an origin or axis, it then turns back toward it. The term is used most frequently to describe supply curves for which the quantity supplied declines as price rises above some point, as may happen in a labor supply curve, the supply curve for foreign exchange, or an offer curve.
<br><b>Backward innovation:</b>  Building a more basic version of an existing product for a lesser-developed market.  
<br><b>Backward integration:</b>  Acquisition by a firm of its suppliers.  
<br><b>Backward linkage:</b> The use by one firm or industry of produced inputs from another firm or industry.

<br><b>Balance of merchandise trade:</b>   The value of a country's merchandise exports minus the value of its merchandise imports.  
<br><b>Balance of payments adjustment mechanism:</b>   Any process, especially any automatic one, by which a country with a payments imbalance moves toward balance of payments equilibrium. Under the gold standard, this was the specie flow mechanism.   
<br><b>Balance of payments argument for protection:</b>   A common reason for restricting imports, especially under fixed exchange rates, when a country is losing international reserves due to a trade deficit. It can be argued that this is a second best argument, since a devaluation could solve the problem without distorting the economy and therefore at smaller economic cost.  
<br><b>Balance of payments deficit:</b> A negative balance of payments surplus.   
<br><b>Balance of payments equilibrium:</b>   Meaningful only under a pegged exchange rate, this referred to equality of credits and debits in the balance of payments using the traditional definition of the capital account. A surplus or deficit implied changing official reserves, so that something would ultimately have to change.  
<br><b>Balance of payments surplus:</b>   A number summarizing the state of a country's international transactions, usually equal to the balance on current account plus the balance on capital account. This equals zero* and is uninformative under the modern definition of the latter, but with official reserve transactions excluded, or omitting also other volatile short-term capital-account transactions, it indicates the stress on a regime of pegged exchange rates.   
<br><b>Balance of payments:</b>  Net value of all economic transactions-including trade in goods and services, transfer payments, loans, and investments-between residents of the same country and those of all other countries.     The International Money FundÃ¢ÂÂs accounting system that tracks the flow of goods, services, and capital in and out of each country.  It is a list or accounting, of all of a country's international transactions for a given time period, usually one year. Payments into the country (receipts) are entered as positive numbers, called credits; payments out of the country (payments) are entered as negative numbers called debits.   A single number summarizing all of a country's international transactions: the balance of payments surplus.   
<br><b>Balance of trade:</b>    The difference between a countryÃ¢ÂÂs total imports and exports.  It is the net flows of goods (exports minus imports) between countries.	
It is the value of a country's exports minus the value of its imports. Unless specified as the balance of merchandise trade, it normally incorporates trade in services, including earnings (interest, dividends, etc.) on capital.  	
<br><b>Balance on capital account:</b>   A country's receipts minus payments for capital account transactions.   	
<br><b>Balance on current account:</b>   A country's receipts minus payments for current account transactions. It equals the balance of trade plus net inflows of transfer payments.   	
<br><b>Balance sheet:</b>   A statement showing a firm's accounting value on a particular date. It reflects the equation, Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' equity.	
It is a summary of a firm's financial position on a given date that shows total assets = total liabilities - owners' equity.	
<br><b>Balanced budget: <br></b>	1.  A government budget surplus that is zero, thus with net tax revenue equaling expenditure.  <br>2.  A balanced budget change in policy or behavior is one in which a component of the government budget, usually taxes, is adjusted as necessary to maintain a balanced budget.

<br><b>Community preferences:</b>  A set of consumer preferences, analogous to those of an individual as might be represented by a utility function, but representing the preferences of a group of consumers. The existence of well-behaved community preferences requires restrictive assumptions about individual preferences and/or incomes.

<br><b>Consignment:</b> Delivery of merchandise from an exporter (i.e. the consignor) to an agent (i.e. the consignee) under agreement that the consignee sells the merchandise of the account of the consignor, while the consignor retains title to the goods until the consignee sells them.  Under this selling method, goods are only shipped, but not sold, to the importer. The exporter (consignor) retains title to the goods until the importer (consignee) has sold them to a third party. This arrangement is normally made only with a related company because of the large risks involved.<br> 1.

<br><b>Effective annual interest rate:</b>    The interest rate as if it were compounded once per time period rather than several times per period. The actual rate of interest earned (paid) after adjusting the nominal rate for factors such as the number of compounding periods per year.
<br><b>Effective exchange rate:</b>   An index of a currency's value relative to a group (or basket) of other currencies, where the currencies in the basket are given weights based on the amount of trade between the countries that use the currencies. It is also called a trade-weighted exchange rate.  	
<br><b>Effective Interest Rate:</b>  The true cost of a loan; it equals the annual interest paid divided by the funds received. 	
<br><b>Effective protection:</b>   The concept that the protection provided to an industry depends on the tariffs and other trade barriers on both its inputs and its outputs, since a tariff on inputs raises cost.  Measured by the effective rate of protection.  	
<br><b>Effective protective rate:</b>   Same as effective rate of protection. 	
<br><b>Effective tariff:</b>   Effective rate of protection.	
<br><b>Efficient allocation:</b>   An allocation that it is impossible unambiguously to improve upon, in the sense of producing more of one good without producing less of another. 	
<br><b>Efficient financial market:</b>   A financial market in which current prices fully reflect all available relevant information.	
<br><b>Efficient frontier:</b> The mean-variance efficient portion of the investment opportunity set. The set of portfolios that has the smallest possible standard deviation for its level of expected return and has the maximum expected return for a given level of risk. 	
<br><b>Efficient market:</b> A market in which prices reflect all relevant information. A market in which, at a minimum, current price changes are independent of past price changes, or, more strongly, price reflects all (publicly) available information. Some believe foreign exchange markets to be efficient, which in turn implies that future exchange rates cannot profitably be predicted.   One in which new information is readily incorporated in the prices of traded securities. 	
<br><b>Elastic offer curve:</b>   An offer curve along which import demand is always elastic. It is therefore not backward bending. Contrasts with inelastic offer curve.  	
<br><b>Elastic:</b>   Having an elasticity greater than one. For a price elasticity of demand, this means that expenditure rises as price falls. For income elasticity it means that expenditure share rises with income, a superior good. It contrasts with inelastic and unit elastic. Elastic demand for either exports or imports is sufficient to satisfy the Marshall-Lerner condition. 	
<br><b>Elasticities approach:<br></b>	1. The method of analyzing the determination of the balance of trade, especially due to devaluation, that focuses on the price elasticities of exports and imports. According to this approach, the effect depends critically on the Marshall-Lerner Condition.  <br>2. The explanation of exchange rates using supply and demand curves. 
<br><b>Elasticity of demand for exports:</b>   This is normally the price elasticity of demand for exports of a country, either for a single industry or for the aggregate of all imports.  It equals the rest of world's elasticity of demand for imports, which therefore also enters the Marshall-Lerner condition.	
<br><b>Elasticity of demand for imports:</b>   This is normally the price elasticity of demand for imports of a country, either for a single industry or for the aggregate of all imports. The latter plays a critical role in determining how the country's balance of trade responds to the exchange rate. 	
<br><b>Elasticity of substitution:</b>   The elasticity of the ratio of two inputs to a production (or utility) function with respect to the ratio of their marginal products (or utilities). With competitive demands, this is also the elasticity with respect to their price ratio.	
<br><b>Elasticity of transformation:</b>   The elasticity of an economy's output of one good with respect to its output of another (holding other outputs, if there are any, constant). 	
<br><b>Electronic commerce (EC):</b>   The exchange of business information in an electronic (nonpaper) format, including over the Internet.

Originally this term was applied to countries that had recently ceased to be part of the Soviet Union and its satellites, and thus emerging from centrally planned communist economies. The term drew attention to their transition to becoming market economies.  <br>2. Rather quickly, perhaps acknowledging the importance of central planning and the failure of markets in many other countries, the term has expanded to encompass also developing countries, not necessarily ever communist, as they expanded the role of markets.   
<br><b>Emerging market:</b> An emerging market has a very high growth rate, which yields enormous market potential. It is distinguished by the recent progress it has made in economic liberalization.

<br><b>Environmental dumping:</b>   Export of a good from a country with weak or poorly enforced environmental regulations, reflecting the idea that the exporter's cost of production is below the true cost to society, providing an unfair advantage in international trade. It is also called eco-dumping. 
<br><b>Environmental Kuznets Curve:</b>  An inverse U-shaped relationship hypothesized between per capita income and environmental degradation. <br><b>Environmental protection argument for a trade intervention:</b>   The view that trade should be restricted in order to help the environment. Examples include embargos on imports made from endangered species, limits on imports produced by methods harmful to the atmosphere, and restrictions on investment into locations with lax environmental standards.

<br><b>Equivalent variation:</b>   The amount of money that, paid to a person, group, or whole economy, would make them as well off as a specified change in the economy. It provides a monetary measure of the welfare effect of that change that is similar to, but not in general the same as, compensating variation.	
<br><b>Erosion:</b> Cash-flow amount transferred to a new project from customers and sales of other products of the firm. 	
<br><b>Escalation:<br></b>	1. Regarding the structure of tariffs, such as tariff escalation.  <br>2. In the context of a trade war, escalation refers to the increase in tariffs that occurs as countries retaliate again and again.

<br><b>Exchange rate protection:</b>  The manipulation of the exchange rate so as to increase the domestic prices of, and demand for, domestically produced goods. Since an undervalued currency stimulates demand for all domestically produced tradable goods, this form of protection, unlike tariff protection, can only be provided to the tradable sector as a whole, not to individual industries.
<br><b>Exchange rate regime:</b>   The rules under which a country's exchange rate is determined, especially the way the monetary or other government authorities do or do not intervene in the exchange market.

Provides guarantees of working capital loans for U.S. exporters, guarantees the repayment of loans or makes loans to foreign purchasers of U.S. goods and services, and provides credit insurance against non-payment by foreign buyers for political or commercial risk. Currently, the Bank is focusing on critical areas such as emphasizing exports to developing countries, aggressively countering trade subsidies of other governments, stimulating small business transactions, promoting the export of environmentally beneficial goods and services, and expanding project finance capabilities. Ex-Im Bank is not an aid or development agency, but a government held corporation, managed by a Board of Directors. 	
<br><b>Exogenous growth:</b>   	Economic growth that occurs without being the result of deliberate policy or behavior.

What people think a variable is going to be. In general, the expectation in this second sense may be more important than the first for determining behavior on a market, such as the exchange market. 
<br><b>Experience good:</b>  A product whose value can be better known after having consumed it. Producers of experience goods may temporarily charge a price lower than marginal cost to induce buyers to try the product. Done with an export, this would be legally considered dumping.

<br><b>Immiserizing growth:</b>   Economic growth that makes the country worse off. Bhagwati (1958) coined the term for growth that expands exports and worsens the terms of trade sufficiently that its real income falls.

<br><b>Imperfect capital mobility:</b>   Any departure from perfect capital mobility, permitting interest rates or returns to capital to differ between countries.	
<br><b>Imperfect competition:</b>   Any departure from perfect competition. However, imperfect competition usually refers to one of the market structures other than perfect competition.	It refers to an economic agent (firm or consumer), group of agents (industry), model, or analysis that is characterized by imperfect competition. It contrasts with perfectly competitive.	
<br><b>Implicit price deflator:</b>   A broad measure of prices derived from separate estimates of real and nominal expenditures for GDP or a subcategory of GDP.

<br><b>Import demand elasticity:</b>   The elasticity of demand for imports with respect to price.	
<br><b>Import license:</b> A document required and issued by some national government authorizing the importation of goods into their individual countries.	The license to import under an import quota or under exchange controls.    Licenses required by some countries to bring in a foreign-made good. In many cases, import licenses are also used by the issuing country to control the quantity of imported items.	
<br><b>Import parity price:</b>   A price charged for a domestically produced good that is set equal to the domestic price of an equivalent imported good -- thus the world price plus transport cost plus tariff.	
<br><b>Import penetration:</b>   A measure of the importance of imports in the domestic economy, either by sector or overall, usually defined as the value of imports divided by the value of apparent consumption.	
<br><b>Import price index:</b>   Price index of the goods that a country imports.	
<br><b>Import promotion:</b>   Any policy that encourages imports. A policy of export promotion generally has the side effect of stimulating imports as well. Today the term is more commonly used for policies used by developed countries intended to assist developing countries in exporting to them.	
<br><b>Import propensity:</b>   The marginal propensity to import (or sometimes the average propensity, if they are different).	
<br><b>Import relief:</b>   Usually refers to some form of restraint of imports in a particular sector in order to assist domestic producers, and with the connotation that these producers have been suffering from the competition with imports. If done formally under existing statutes, it is administered protection, but it may also be done informally using a VER.	
<br><b>Import substitute:</b>   A good produced on the domestic market that competes with imports, either as a perfect substitute or as a differentiated product.  	
<br><b>Import substituting industrialization:</b>   A strategy for economic development based on replacing imports with domestic production.

Because it represents an increase in what the country gets in return for what it gives up, this is associated with an improvement in the country's welfare, although whether that actually occurs depends on the reason prices changed.	
<br><b>Improve the trade balance:</b>   This conventionally refers to an increase in exports relative to imports, which thus causes the balance of trade to become larger if positive or smaller if negative. The terminology ignores that exports drain resources while imports satisfy domestic needs, and reflects instead the association of exports with either accumulation of wealth or jobs.

Common forms include homogeneous of degree greater than one and production with constant marginal cost but positive fixed cost. It is also called economies of scale, scale economies, and simply increasing returns. It contrasts with decreasing returns and constant returns.	
<br><b>Incremental capital output ratio:</b>   The amount of additional capital that a developing country requires to increase its output by one unit; thus the reciprocal of the marginal product of capital.

<br><b>Industrialization:</b>   The establishment and subsequent growth of industrial production in a country, usually meaning heavy manufacturing.	
<br><b>Inelastic offer curve:</b>   An offer curve with inelastic demand for imports. That inelasticity implies that exports decline as imports increase, and it therefore means that the offer curve is backward bending. Strictly speaking, the natural definition of an offer curve's elasticity would be negative in this case, not just less than one, but that definition is seldom used.	
<br><b>Inelastic:</b>   Having an elasticity less than one. For a price elasticity of demand, this means that expenditure falls as price falls. For income elasticity it means that expenditure share falls with income. It casts with elastic and unit elastic.

If the exchange rate breaches this barrier, the holder cannot exercise this option, even if it ends up in-the-money. It is also known as barrier options.    
<br><b>Kuznets Curve:</b>   An inverse U-shaped relationship between per capita income and inequality, suggesting that inequality is low in very poor countries, rises as they develop, and then ultimately falls as income rises still further.

<br><b>Leontief Paradox:</b>   The finding of Leontief (1954) that U.S. imports embodied a higher ratio of capital to labor than U.S. exports. This was surprising because it was thought that the U.S. was capital abundant, and the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem would then predict that U.S. exports would be relatively capital intensive.

<br><b>Lerner paradox:</b>   The possibility that a tariff might worsen a country's terms of trade. This can happen only if the country spends a disproportionately large fraction of the tariff revenue on the imported good, and it does not happen (from a stable equilibrium) if the tariff revenue is redistributed. 
<br><b>Lerner Symmetry Theorem:</b>   The proposition that a tax on all imports has the same effect as an equal tax on all exports, if the revenue is spent in the same way. The result depends critically on balanced trade, as in a real model, so that a change in imports leads to an equal change in the value of exports. 	
<br><b>Lerner-Pearce Diagram:</b>   This name is sometimes given (for years, by me at least) to the Lerner Diagram. In fact, Pearce's (1952) diagram uses unit isoquants rather than unit value isoquants and is much more cumbersome.

Today it usually means a nominal interest rate so near zero that lowering it further is impossible or ineffective.  
<br><b>Liquidity:</b>   The ability of an asset to be converted into cash without a significant price concession.   The capacity to turn assets into cash, or the amount of assets in a portfolio that have that capacity. Cash itself (i.e., money) is the most liquid asset.

<br><b>Monetary approach:</b>   A framework for analyzing exchange rates and the balance of payments that focuses on supply and demand for money in different countries. A floating exchange rate is assumed to equate supply and demand and thus to reflect relative growth rates of money supplies and determinants of demand.

Both refer to the quantity of money that people in the country hold (a stock), not to the quantity that people both in and out of the country choose to acquire during a period in the exchange market, mostly for the purpose of then using it to buy something else. Financial markets for debt securities that pay off in the short term, usually less than one year. 	
<br><b>Money overhang:</b>   A money supply that is larger than people want to hold at prevailing prices. This was said to be a major cause of inflation in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union, which left an excess of money in circulation. 	
<br><b>Money Supply:</b>    The total amount of currency in circulation and peso deposits subject to check of the monetary system. There are several formal definitions, but all include the quantity of currency in circulation plus the amount of demand deposits. The money supply, together with the amount of real economic activity in a country, is an important determinant of its price level and its exchange rate.  	
<br><b>Money-Market Hedge:</b>  The use of simultaneous borrowing and lending transactions in two different currencies to lock in the home currency value of a foreign currency transaction.	
<br><b>Monopolistic:</b>   Having some power to set price.

<br><b>National debt:</b>   Although this term looks like it should mean the amount that a country owes to foreigners, in practice it is used instead to refer to the amount that a nation's government owes to anybody, including its own citizens. Thus it is the total of a national government's outstanding government bonds.  
<br><b>NAIRU:</b>   The level of the unemployment rate at which prices rise at the same rate that they are expected to rise, and thus at which (since expectations needn't change) the rate of inflation does not then rise or fall. It stands for Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment.

E.g., in a tariff-and-retaliation game, with each country able to improve its terms of trade with a tariff, zero tariffs are not Nash, since each can do better by raising its tariff. Nash equilibrium, with positive tariffs, is likely to be inferior to free trade for both. 
<br><b>National defense argument for protection:</b>   The argument that imports should be restricted in order to sustain a domestic industry so that it will be available in case of trade disruption due to war.

Said of economic growth if it expands actual or potential output of all goods at the same rate, not being biased in favor of one over another. In the Heckscher-Ohlin Model neutral growth will occur all factor endowments grow at the same rate or if there is Hicks Neutral technological progress at the same rate in all industries.  <br>3. Said of a trade regime if the structure of protection favors neither exportable nor importable.

<br><b>Nominal (stated) interest rate:</b>   A rate of interest quoted for a year that has not been adjusted for frequency of compounding. If interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate will be higher than the nominal rate.	
<br><b>Nominal anchor:</b>   The technique of fixing a nominal variable in an economy as a means of reducing inflation. For example, by firmly pegging the nominal exchange rate, a central bank or government reduces its own ability to expand the money supply.  	
<br><b>Nominal cash flow:</b> A cash flow expressed in nominal terms if the actual dollars to be received (or paid out) are given. 	
<br><b>Nominal Exchange Rate:</b>  The actual exchange rate; it is expressed in current units of currency. The actual exchange rate at which currencies are exchanged on an exchange market.

<br><b>Nondistorting lump sum:</b>   Redundant appellation for a lump sum tax or subsidy. 
<br><b>Noneconomic objectives argument for protection:</b>   The view that a restriction on imports may serve a purpose outside of conventional economic models.

<br><b>Nonsterilization:</b>   Refers to exchange market intervention that is done without sterilizing its effects on the domestic money supply.  
<br><b>Nontariff barrier:</b>  Any policy that interferes with exports or imports other than a simple tariff, prominently including quotas and VERs.  An indirect measure used to discriminate against foreign manufacturers, for example, extensive inspection procedures for foreign imports that create barriers to entering the market. 
<br><b>Nontariff measure:</b>   Any policy or official practice that alters the conditions of international trade, including ones that act to increase trade as well as those that restrict it. The term is therefore broader than nontariff barrier, although the two are usually used interchangeably.

<br><b>Nontradable:</b><br> 1. Not capable of being traded among countries.  <br>2. A good or service that is nontradable; with nontradables referring to an aggregate of such goods and services.  
<br><b>Nontraded good:</b>   A good that is not traded, either because it cannot be or because trade barriers are too high. Except when services are being distinguished from goods, they are often mentioned as examples of nontraded goods, or at least they were until it became common to speak of trade in services.

<br><b>One-way option:</b>   Refers to the situation of a speculator on an exchange market with a pegged exchange rate. If there is doubt about the viability of the peg, the speculator can sell the currency short knowing that there is only one direction (one way) that the currency is likely to move.

<br><b>Patriotism argument for protection:</b>   The view that one is helping one's country by buying domestically produced goods instead of imports. In a nondistorted economy, this is not correct, since the country can do better producing where it has a comparative advantage rather than using scarce resources where it does not. 	
<br><b>Pattern of specialization:</b>   Which goods a country produces and which it does not produce.   	
<br><b>Pauper labor argument:</b>   The view that a country loses by importing from another country that has low wages, presumably by lowering wages at home.

<br><b>Real:</b><br>1. Expressed in terms of the amount of goods and service that something is worth at market prices.  <br>2. Adjusted for inflation.  <br>3. Referring only to real economic variables as opposed to nominal, or monetary ones, as in real models.  <br>4. Used with appreciation or depreciation, refers to the real exchange rate. Thus a real appreciation means that the nominal value of a country's currency has increased by more than its relative price level may have decreased, so that the prices of its goods relative to foreign goods have increased.  <br>5.

<br><b>Rules-based trade policy:</b>   Institutional arrangements in which national trade policies are governed by internationally agreed-upon rules, as in the GATT and WTO.   	
<br><b>Run on a currency:</b>   The short-term capital outflows that occur when a pegged exchange rate regime is thought to be running out of reserves and is thus expected (and therefore forced) to devalue.  	
<br><b>Rybczynski derivative:</b>   The effect of a small change in a single factor endowment on the output of a good.   	
<br><b>Rybczynski Theorem:</b>   The property of the Heckscher-Ohlin Model that, at constant prices, an increase in the endowment of one factor increases the output of the industry that uses that factor intensively and reduces the output of the other (or some other) industry.

<br><b>Second best:</b>   It refers to what is the optimal policy when the true optimum (the first best) is unavailable due to constraints on policy choice. The Theory of Second Best says that a policy that would be optimal without such constraints (such as a zero tariff in a small country) may not be second-best optimal if other policies is constrained. 	
<br><b>Second theorem of welfare economics:</b> The proposition of welfare economics that any Pareto optimal allocation can be attained by a competitive general equilibrium.

<br><b>Segmented market:</b> A market that is partially or wholly isolated from other markets by one or more market imperfections. 	
<br><b>Seigniorage:</b>   The difference between what money can buy and its cost of production.
